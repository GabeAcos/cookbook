Ingredients
FOR THE DOUGH:

• 2¼ cups/530 milliliters lukewarm water (105 to 110 degrees)

• 2 tablespoons barley malt syrup, (available in health food stores and some well-stocked supermarkets; an equal volume of molasses is a passable substitute, but won’t impart the traditional malty flavor)

• 1 (¼-ounce) packet active dry yeast (about 2¼ teaspoons)

• 6½ cups/885 grams bread flour (or use 6 cups bread flour and ½ cup whole-wheat flour), plus more for kneading

Tip: For the crustiest, chewiest bagels, use bread flour. However, you can still achieve good results with all-purpose flour. Just try to use a brand with a relatively high protein content. Swapping in ½ cup of whole-wheat flour for ½ cup of the bread flour will make the bagels slightly less chewy but will also give them a boost of flavor.

• 2 tablespoons/17 grams Diamond Crystal kosher salt or 1 tablespoon/17 grams Morton kosher salt

Tip: When measured by volume, Morton salt packs more densely than Diamond, making it about twice as salty. 
For consistent measurements across brands, either weigh it with a scale, or use half the volume of Morton.

• Neutral oil, for greasing the baking sheets

FOR ASSEMBLY:

• 1 teaspoon baking soda

• ¼ cup/60 milliliters barley malt syrup, plus more as needed

• 2 ounces/30 grams each sesame seeds, poppy seeds, caraway seeds, dried minced garlic, 
  dried minced onion and/or flaky salt (optional)

Equipment
Scale (optional but recommended), a small bowl, a large mixing bowl, flexible spatula or wooden spoon,
bench scraper, two large rimmed baking sheets, parchment paper, plastic wrap, a spider or slotted spoon, 
tea towel, a large Dutch oven, several separate large plates (if topping bagels), wire rack and a serrated knife.
